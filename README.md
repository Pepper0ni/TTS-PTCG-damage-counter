# TTS-PTCG-damage-counter
A script for a 10-400 40-in-1 PTCG damage counter, to be added to a custom token with 5.0 merge distance.

Credit to [RomyKing's Pokemon TCG mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1519366487) for the damage counter this was built off of.

Unlike RomyKing's counter, this uses a script to change between the counters when a number is pressed. This makes for a smaller filesize(and thus less loading) than the original counter for those who want the absolute most perforament games as well as less maintainance for modders (as there is only 1 object not 40). 

The cost to this approach is that there is no way to replaicate the state-switching right click option, so only the number keys can be used to change the counter's number.
